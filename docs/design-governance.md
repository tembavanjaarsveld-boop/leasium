# Leasium Design Governance

Last updated: 2026-05-19

Remba is the required UX sign-off for design-facing changes. Any change that affects navigation, page layout, forms, density, interaction flow, dashboard content, visual hierarchy, empty/loading/error states, or customer-facing copy needs a Remba review before it is considered complete.

## Remba Review Gate

- [ ] Remba has reviewed the affected screen or flow.
- [ ] The change keeps the primary job obvious within the first viewport.
- [ ] The screen has one clear purpose, not a pile of unrelated admin tools.
- [ ] Frequent actions are faster than rare configuration actions.
- [ ] Empty, loading, error, and success states are written in plain language.
- [ ] The UI uses familiar controls and icons instead of explanatory walls of text.
- [ ] Tables and dense work areas remain scannable on laptop-size screens.
- [ ] New pages fit the product structure: dashboard, property workspace, tenant workspace, or a clear module page.

## Standing UX Direction

- Home is a dashboard: quick adds, notifications, events, updates, and operational health.
- Insights is the portfolio dashboard layer: live health, exceptions, automation activity, and shareable snapshots generated later from the same data.
- Property work belongs in the property workspace: lease intake, units, leases, obligations, rent roll, and property-level billing readiness.
- Tenant work belongs in the tenant workspace: tenant search, contact/billing details, onboarding state, leases, documents, and activity.
- New modules should earn their own page when they become repeated work, not be squeezed into an existing page.
- Leasium should feel like modern tooling for operators: calm, fast, clear, and confident.

## Current Remba Review

Status: pass with fixes. Remba approved the tenant onboarding command center and
tenant detail direction on 2026-05-19, provided tenant workflow stays in the
tenant workspace rather than being added to the crowded property workspace.

Required fixes before major new feature work:

- Split `/properties` into clearer task zones or tabs instead of one long control panel.
- Move always-visible create/edit forms into contextual drawers or focused panels.
- Make dashboard cards and rows actionable, with clear drill-ins to the relevant workspace.
- Add tenant profile/detail surfaces beyond the tenant table and side form.
- Rework public onboarding into calmer guided sections with better context and next-step reassurance.

Completed in the tenant workspace slice:

- `/tenants` now acts as a tenant onboarding command center with counts, search, status filters, and an action queue.
- `/tenants/[tenantId]` now owns the tenant profile, linked leases, onboarding actions, document placeholder, and activity history.
- The always-visible tenant create/edit form has been replaced with focused create/edit panels.
- Public tenant onboarding now shows property, unit, lease context, guided sections, notes, proper reset behavior, and next-step reassurance without adding upload UI before storage is ready.

Standing additions from Remba:

- No new major feature may be added to a crowded page without deciding its home first.
- Tables are for scanning; forms are for focused action.
- Every dashboard item should answer what happened, whether it is urgent, and what to do next.
- Icon-only actions need labels via tooltips or menus unless the icon is universally obvious.
- Public tenant screens must feel calmer and more guided than internal admin screens.

## Smart Intake Apply Sign-Off

Status: pass. Remba approved extending Smart Intake apply beyond insurance certificates on 2026-05-19, provided the flow stays review-first, target scope is plain-language, and the user sees a compact post-apply outcome card showing what was created.

Applied UX guardrails:

- Keep confirmation in the review panel area rather than a modal.
- Show what changed, target scope, first due date, source document, and ignored item count.
- Use `Portfolio level`, `No unit scope`, and `No lease scope` wording for intentional scope choices.
- Provide one clear next action to review created work in Tasks.
